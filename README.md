  This project is a film website built using React and Vite, designed to show movies and their details. It uses modern tools like React Router for navigation and may include styling with CSS. The app is structured with reusable components to display movies, search, and view individual film pages. Currently, it fetches movie data from an external API but the API integration and search features are still being developed. To run it locally, you clone the repo, install dependencies, and start the server.
